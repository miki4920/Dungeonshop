Hardware requirements:
The program requires a dedicated GPU. As of current, the program has been tested on RTX 2080 SUPER and 3070 TI. The program will likely work on AMD GPUs, although this has not been tested. Ensure that the GPU is compatible with shader version cs_5_0.
Additionally, the program requires a multi-core CPU, requiring at least 4 cores to function correctly.  

This software has following requirements:
Windows 10/11 (Any system capable of running Unity Version 2022.2.10f1 should work but only those )
Unity Version 2022.2.10f1
The user should download the entire project from the GitLab repository, either through git or the website itself.
Once that happens, using Unity Hub to open project and load it. With the project loaded, pressing play at the top would result in the project running.
